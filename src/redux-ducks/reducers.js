// NOTE: some Thunks (asynchronous calls) may escape early
//       (e.g. return cached data) instead of returning a promise.
//
// A consequence of this is that you can't call .then() on them safely.
// A workaround is to forcefully return a promise so that any function can use
// .then() regardless of cached data or fetch from the server.
//
// Not every function has had this modification made, only the ones that have caused problems.
